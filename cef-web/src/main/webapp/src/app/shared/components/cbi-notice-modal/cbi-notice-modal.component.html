  <p>Do not submit information you claim as confidential business information (CBI) to EPA via CAERS. 
  EPA may make the information submitted through CAERS available to the public without further notice 
  to you. You may assert claims of business confidentiality for any information you submit to EPA; 
  however, that information should not be submitted through CAERS. Any information claimed as confidential 
  business information must be submitted to your State, Local, Tribal authority. Information claimed as 
  confidential will be treated in accordance with the procedures for handling information claimed as 
  confidential under 40 CFR part 2, subpart B, and will be disclosed to the extent, and by means of 
  procedures, set forth in Subpart B. If no claim of confidentiality is asserted when the information 
  is received by EPA, it may be made available to the public without further notice to the respondents. 
  See 40 CFR 2.203(a), 41 Fed. Reg. 36,907. Furthermore, under section 114(c) of the Clean Air Act, 
  emissions data is not entitled to confidential treatment and requires EPA to make emissions data available 
  to the public. Thus, emissions data will not be protected as CBI and will be made publicly available.</p>
